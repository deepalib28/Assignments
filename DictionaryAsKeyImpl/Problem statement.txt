	a. Ability to add a key value 
	b. Update value by key
	c. Delete value by using key

All the above operations should be based on the identity of the class.

Ensure that it adheres to the properties of equality with below test cases: 

1. Equals must be reflexive; that is, 
x.Equals(x) must return true. 

2. Equals must be symmetric; that is, 
x.Equals(y) must return the same value as y.Equals(x). 

3. Equals must be transitive; that is, 
if x.Equals(y) returns true 
and y.Equals(z) returns true, 
then x.Equals(z) must also return true.

4. Add some sample data and verify the add, update and delete through test cases.
